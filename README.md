# Better Calculator
My new repo!
-This is my first Project in github. 
-This is a Calculator which I was compelled to make as all the already available options were'nt satisfactory to my choice.
-I took up this project as a lockdown hobby but later turned it into a serious project as I had to do something for my University Assignment.
-This is a completely new concept. 
-Please contribute to it üôè and show me how to imporve my github skills and update this project :)
